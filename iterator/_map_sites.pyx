        lattice. ``site`` attribute are added to the atoms in the ``mappee`` structure. These
        attributes hold an index to the relevant sites in the mapper.  If a particular atom could
        not be mapped, then ``site`` is None

            Can be set to a callable which shall take two atoms as input and return True if their
